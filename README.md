# Hello_world

Hi, I am a civil engineer. I want to learn more about programming for creating something new in my field.
So, I made this repository as my first step in github. 

What I major in in school is structural engineering, and my research is about structural optimization.
If anyone is interested in my work, please feel free to contact me with e-mail.

My e-mail adresss: r02521252@ntu.edu.tw or zhanxun_bear@163.com

By the way, I do love :pizza: and :coffee: :smile:
